   authoritative DNS servers as well as recursive DNS resolvers support
   both IPv4 and IPv6.  It furthermore provides guidance for how
   recursive DNS resolvers should select upstream DNS servers, if
   synthesized and non-synthesized IPv6 addresses are available.

   This document obsoletes RFC 3901. (if approved)

1.  Introduction

   Despite IPv6 being first discussed in the mid-1990s [RFC2460],
   consistent deployment throughout the whole Internet has not yet been
   accomplished [RFC9386].  Hence, today, the Internet consists of
   IPv4-only, dual-stack (networks supporting both IP versions), and
   IPv6-only networks.

   This creates a complex landscape where authoritative DNS servers
   might be accessible only via specific network protocols
   [V6DNSRDY-23].  At the same time, DNS resolvers may only be able to
   access the Internet via either IPv4 or IPv6.  This poses a challenge
   for such resolvers because they may receive queries for names that
   have authoritative DNS servers which do not support the same IP
   version as the resolver.

   [RFC3901] was initially written at a time when IPv6 deployment was
   not widespread, focusing primarily on maintaining name space
   continuity within the IPv4 landscape.  Two decades later, IPv6 is not
   only widely deployed but also becoming the de facto standard in many
   areas.  This document seeks to expand the scope of RFC3901 by
   recommending IPv6 connectivity for authoritative DNS servers, as well
   as recursive and stub DNS resolvers.

   This document provides guidance on:

   *  IP version related name space fragmentation and best-practices for
      avoiding it.

   *  Guidelines for configuring authoritative DNS servers for zones.

   *  Guidelines for operating recursive DNS resolvers.

   *  Guidelines for stub DNS resolvers.

   While transitional technologies and dual-stack setups may mitigate
   some of the issues of DNS resolution in a mixed protocol-version
   Internet, making DNS data accessible over both IPv4 and IPv6 is the
   most robust and flexible approach.  This approach allows resolvers to
   reach the information they need without requiring intermediary
   translation or forwarding services which may introduce additional
   failure cases.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses DNS terminology as described in [RFC9499].
   Furthermore, the following terms are used with a defined meaning:

   IPv4 name server:
      A name server providing DNS services reachable via IPv4.  It does
      not imply anything about what DNS data is served, but means that
      the name server receives and answers queries over IPv4.

   IPv6 name server:
      A name server providing DNS services reachable via IPv6.  It does
      not imply anything about what DNS data is served, but means that
      the name server receives and answers queries over IPv6.

   Dual-stack name server:
      A name server that is both an "IPv4 name server" and also an "IPv6
      name server".

3.  Name Space Fragmentation

   A resolver that tries to look up a name starts out at the root, and
   follows referrals until it is referred to a name server set that is
   authoritative for the name.  If it is referred to a name server set
   that is, based on a referral, only contains name servers that are
   exclusively reachable via an IP address family the resolver does not
   support, the resolver is unable to continue DNS resolution.

   If this occurs, the DNS has, effectively, fragmented based on the
   recursive DNS resolver's and authoritative DNS server's mismatching
   IP version support.

   In a mixed IP Internet, name space fragmentation can occur for
   different reasons.  One reason is that DNS zones are consistently
   configured to support only either IPv4 or IPv6.  Another reason is
   due to misconfigurations that make a zone unresolvable by either IPv4
   or IPv6-only resolvers.  The latter cases are often hard to identify,
   as the impact of misconfigurations for only one IP version (IPv4 or
   IPv6) may be hidden in a dual-stack setting.  In the worst case, a
   specific name may only be resolvable via dual-stack enabled
   resolvers.

3.1.  Misconfigurations Causing IP Version Related Name Space
      Fragmentation

   Even when an administrator assumes that they have enabled support for
   a specific IP version on their authoritative DNS server, various
   misconfigurations may break the DNS delegation chain of a zone for
   that protocol and prevent any of its records from resolving for
   clients only supporting that IP version.  These misconfigurations can
   be kept hidden if most clients can successfully fall back to the
   other IP version.

   The following name related misconfigurations can cause broken
   delegation for one IP version:

   No A/AAAA records for NS names:
      If all of the NS records for a zone in their parent zone have
      either only A records or only AAAA records, then resolution via
      the other IP version is not possible.

   Missing GLUE:
      If the name from an NS record for a zone is in-domain, i.e., the
      name is within the zone or below, a parent zone needs to contain
      both IPv4 and IPv6 GLUE records.  A parent needs to serve the
      corresponding A and AAAA records as ADDITIONAL data when returning
      the NS record(s) as the referral response [RFC9471].

   No A/AAAA record for in-domain NS:
      If the parent provides GLUE records for both IP versions but the
      child zone itself lacks corresponding A or AAAA records for its
      in-domain name server names, resolution via the missing IP version
      will fail during delegation revalidation
      [I-D.ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation].

   Zone of sibling domain NSes not resolving:
      If the name from an NS record for a zone is sibling domain, the
      corresponding zone needs to be resolvable via the IP version in
      question as well.  It is insufficient if the name pointed to by
      the NS record has an associated A or AAAA record correspondingly.

   Parent zone not resolvable via one IP version:
      For a zone to be resolvable via an IP version the parent zones up
      to the root zone needs to be resolvable via that IP version as
      well.  Any zone not resolvable via the concerned IP version breaks
      the delegation chain for all its children.

   The above misconfigurations are not mutually exclusive.

   Furthermore, any of the misconfigurations above may not only
   materialize via a missing Resource Record (RR) but also via an RR
   providing the IP address of a name server that is not configured to
   answer queries via that IP version [V6DNSRDY-23].

3.2.  Network Conditions Causing IP Version Related Name Space
      Fragmentation

   In addition to explicit misconfigurations in the served DNS zones,
   network conditions may also influence a resolver's ability to resolve
   names in a zone.  The most common issue here are packets requiring
   fragmentation given a reduced path MTU (PMTU) and MTU blackholes,
   i.e., packets being dropped on-path due to exceeding the MTU of the
   link to the next-hop without the sender being notified.  This can
   manifest in the following ways:

   DNS-over-UDP packets requiring fragmentation
      When using EDNS(0) to communicate support for DNS messages larger
      than 512 octets [RFC6891] via traditional DNS-over-UDP transport
      according to RFC1035 [RFC1035], an IP packet carrying a DNS
      response may exceed the PMTU for the path to a resolver.  If an
      authoritative DNS server does not follow [RFC9715], i.e., honors
      EDNS(0) sizes larger than 1232 octets, it will try to fragment the
      packet according to the discovered PMTU.  Such packets mostly
      occur for DNSKEY responses with DNSSEC [RFC4034].

      In general, DNS servers SHOULD follow RFC9715 [RFC9715], which
      provides additional guidance on preventing fragmentation by
      ensuring that the maximum DNS/UDP payload size does not exceed
      1400 octets.  This can be accomplished by setting a corresponding
      EDNS(0) size, with most implementations using a lower EDNS(0) size
      of 1232 octets following [DNSFlagDay2020], to ensure that
      generated packets always fit into lower bound of the IPv6 MTU of
      1280, as defined in [RFC8200].  Hence, DNS servers MAY opt to set
      an EDNS(0) size of 1232 octets following [DNSFlagDay2020].

      Additionally, DNS servers MAY opt to explicitly not rely on path
      MTU discovery [RFC4821] or PLPMTUD [RFC8899], by instead using
      IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU=1 from RFC3542 [RFC3542] to avoid the need to
      perform path MTU discovery.

   DNS-over-TCP packets requiring fragmentation
      A resolver can for various reasons also initiate connections via
      TCP for resolution to an authoritative server.  However, similar
      to the case of DNS-over-UDP, DNS-over-TCP may encounter MTU
      blackholes, especially on IPv6, if PMTUD does not work, if the MSS
      honored by the authoritative DNS server leads to IP packets
      exceeding the PMTU.  In that case, similar to the case of DNS-
      over-UDP, DNS resolution will time out when the recursive DNS
      resolver did not receive a response in time.

      [RFC9715] does not provide explicit guidance on mitigating this
      issue.  However, transferring the guidance from [RFC9715], setting
      an MSS of 1388 octets would reduce the impact of this issue.
      Hence, DNS servers MAY set an MSS of no more than 1388 octets for
      TCP connections.  Similarly, aligned with the recommendations of
      the [DNSFlagDay2020], DNS servers MAY ensure that a total packet
      size of 1280 octets is not exceeded by setting an MSS of 1220
      octets.  Additionally, DNS servers MAY opt to set
      IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU=1 from RFC3542 [RFC3542].

   Broken IP Connectivity at the Resolver
      Similar to authoritative servers, (stub) recursive resolvers may
      face broken IP connectivity for either IPv4 or IPv6:

      IPv4 connectivity for a DNS resolver may experience issues, e.g.,
      if the resolver is behind a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) [RFC6888]
      setup that implements strict timeouts on active sessions, or
      limits the number of available ports for connections.  Similarly,
      [RFC1918] addressing may be in use on the resolver, while address
      translation is not performed, or, similar to the case for IPv6,
      when the DNS resolver has a global IPv4 address, but that address
      is not routed on the resolver's network.

      IPv6 connectivity for a DNS resolver may experience issues, if,
      e.g., a client has been assigned a global unicast IPv6 address,
      but IPv6 traffic is not routed on the resolver's network.
      Similarly, IPv6 connectivity can experience issues when IPv4-IPv6
      transition technologies, e.g., NAT64 [RFC6146] on IPv6-mostly
      networks [RFC9313], or NAT64 connectivity discovered through
      PREF64 [RFC8781] or DNS64 [RFC7050] on IPv6-only networks are in
      use.  There, the synthesized IPv6 addresses used in 464XLAT
      [RFC6877] encounter additional PMTU fluctuation due to the
      difference in header size between IPv4 and IPv6, possibly
      impacting DNS resolution.

   Note: Please note that this document only explicitly discusses DNS-
   over-TCP and DNS-over-UDP.  However, several other transport methods
   between recursive and authoritative DNS severs exit, including DNS
   over various encrypted transports.  Some of these technologies
   provide additional mechanisms for preventing the impact of a reduced
   PMTU or MTU blackholes.  Guidance in this document focuses on IP
   version support, and questions of the underlying transport protocol
   (TCP or UDP).  If DNS servers use an additional protocol layer, e.g.,
   DNS-over-TLS [RFC7858] or DNS-over-QUIC [RFC9250], for their
   communication, and that protocol supports additional measures to
   prevent fragmentation on the IP layer related issues, these measures
   SHOULD be used for the connection.  Otherwise, if the protocol is not
   resilient to IP layer fragmentation related issues by default, the
   above guidance for TCP and UDP based connections SHOULD be applied
   analogously.

3.3.  Reasons for Intentional IP Version Related Name Space
      Fragmentation

   Intentional IP related name space fragmentation occurs if an operator
   consciously decides not to deploy IPv4 or IPv6 for a part of the
   resolution chain.  Most commonly, this is realized by intentionally
   not listing A/AAAA records for NS names.  At the time of writing, the
   share of zones not resolvable via IPv4 is negligible, while a little
   less than 40% of zones are not resolvable via IPv6 [V6DNSRDY-23].
   However, as IPv4 exhaustion progresses, IPv6 adoption will have to
   increase.

4.  Policy Based Avoidance of Name Space Fragmentation

   With the final exhaustion of IPv4 pools in RIRs, e.g., [RIPEV4], and
   the progressing deployment of IPv6, IPv4 and IPv6 have become
   comparably relevant.  Yet, while we now observe the first zones
   becoming exclusively IPv6 resolvable, we also still see a major
   portion of zones solely relying on IPv4 [V6DNSRDY-23].  Hence, at the
   moment, dual stack connectivity is instrumental to be able to resolve
   zones and avoid name space fragmentation.

   Having zones served only by name servers reachable via one IP version
   would fragment the DNS.  Hence, we need to find a way to avoid this
   fragmentation.

   The recommended approach to maintain name space continuity is to use
   administrative policies, as described in this section.

4.1.  Guidelines for Authoritative DNS Server Configuration

   It is usually recommended that DNS zones contain at least two name
   servers, which are geographically diverse and operate under different
   routing policies [IANANS].  To reduce the chance of DNS name space
   fragmentation, it is RECOMMENDED that at least two name servers for a
   zone are dual stack name servers.  Specifically, this means that the
   following minimal requirements SHOULD be implemented for a zone:

   IPv4 adoption:
      Every DNS zone SHOULD be served by at least one IPv4-reachable
      authoritative DNS server to maintain name space continuity.  The
      delegation configuration (Resolution of the parent, resolution of
      sibling domain names, GLUE) MUST NOT rely on IPv6 connectivity
      being available.  As we acknowledge IPv4 scarcity, operators MAY
      opt not to provide DNS services via IPv4, if they can ensure that
      all clients expected to resolve this zone do support DNS
      resolution via IPv6.

   IPv6 adoption:
      Every DNS zone SHOULD be served by at least one IPv6-reachable
      authoritative DNS server to maintain name space continuity.  To
      avoid reachability issues, authoritative DNS servers SHOULD use
      native IPv6 addresses instead of IPv6 addresses synthesized using
      IPv6 transition technologies for receiving queries.  The
      delegation configuration (Resolution of the parent, resolution of
      sibling domain names, GLUE) MUST NOT rely on IPv4 connectivity
      being available.

   Consistency:
      Both IPv4 and IPv6 transports SHOULD serve identical DNS data to
      ensure a consistent resolution experience across different network
      types.

   Avoiding IP Fragmentation:
      IP fragmentation has been reported to be fragile [RFC8900].
      Furthermore, IPv6 transition technologies can introduce unexpected
      MTU breaks, e.g., when NAT64 is used [RFC7269].  Therefore, IP
      fragmentation SHOULD be avoided by following guidance on maximum
      DNS payload sizes [RFC9715] and providing TCP fall-back options
      [RFC7766].  Furthermore, similar to the guidance in [RFC9715],
      authoritative DNS servers MAY set an MSS of either 1388 (analogous
      to [RFC9715]) or 1220 (analogous to the [DNSFlagDay2020]
      suggestions) in TCP sessions carrying DNS responses.

   To prevent name space fragmentation, zone validation processes SHOULD
   ensure that:

   *  There is at least one IPv4 address record and one IPv6 address
      record available for the name servers of any child delegation
      within the zone.

   *  The zone's authoritative servers follow [RFC9715] for avoiding
      fragmentation on DNS-over-UDP.

   *  The zone's authoritative servers support DNS-over-TCP [RFC9210].

   *  The zone's authoritative servers can be reached via IPv4 and IPv6
      when performing DNS resolution via IPv4-only and IPv6-only
      networks respectively.

4.2.  Guidelines for Recursive DNS Resolvers

   Every recursive DNS resolver SHOULD be dual stack.

   While the zones that IPv6-only recursive DNS resolvers can resolve
   are growing, they do not yet cover all zones.  Hence, a recursive DNS
   resolver MAY be IPv6-only, if it uses a transition mechanism that
   allows it to also query IPv4-only authoritative DNS servers, or uses
   a configuration where it forwards queries failing IPv6-only DNS
   resolution to a recursive DNS resolver that is able to perform DNS
   resolution over IPv4.  For example, if a recursive DNS resolver is
   aware of a PREF64 to use for NAT64 [RFC6146], either through static
   configuration or by discovering it [RFC8781], it MAY synthesize IPv6
   addresses for remote authoritative DNS servers.

   Similarly, a recursive DNS resolver MAY be IPv4-only, if it uses a
   configuration where such resolvers forward queries failing IPv4-only
   DNS resolution to a recursive DNS resolver that is able to perform
   DNS resolution over IPv6.

   Finally, when responding to recursive queries sent by stub DNS
   resolvers, a DNS resolver SHOULD follow the above guidance on
   fragmentation avoidance, see also [RFC9715], for communication
   between authoritative DNS servers and recursive DNS resolvers
   analogously.

4.3.  Guidelines for DNS Stub Resolvers

   Contrary to authoritative DNS servers and recursive DNS resolvers,
   stub DNS resolvers are more likely to find themselves in either an
   IPv6-mostly or IPv4-only environment, as they are usually run on end-
   hosts / clients.  Furthermore, a stub DNS resolver has to rely on
   recursive DNS servers discovered for the local network, e.g., using
   DHCPv4 [RFC3456], DHCPv6 [RFC8415], and/or SLAAC [RFC4862].  In that
   case, the stub resolver may obtain multiple different IPv4 and IPv6
   DNS resolver addresses to use.

   To prioritize different IPv4 and IPv6 DNS resolver addresses, a stub
   resolver SHOULD follow [RFC6724].  However, a stub DNS resolver
   SHOULD NOT utilize synthesized addresses if it is able to identify
   them as such, e.g., by having discovered the PREF64 in use for the
   network [RFC8781].

   When providing multiple possible DNS servers to stub resolvers,
   operators SHOULD consider that various implementations can only
   configure a small set of possible DNS resolvers, e.g., only up to
   three for libc, and additional resolvers provided may be ignored by
   clients.

5.  Security Considerations

   The guidelines described in this memo introduce no new security
   considerations into the DNS protocol.

   Recommendations for recursive and stub resolvers rely on a correctly
   discovered PREF64.  Security issues may materialize if an incorrect
   PREF64 is used.  Hence, guidance from [RFC9872] on securely
   discovering PREF64 SHOULD be followed.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to update its technical requirements for
   authoritative DNS servers to require both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for
   each authoritative server [IANANS].
