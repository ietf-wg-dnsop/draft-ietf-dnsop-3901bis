Some level of justification such processes and methods, but the\n   material in Section 3 goes further than a brief justification and\n   presents some general descriptions of DNS pathologies and remedial\n   configuration settings for DNS servers and resolvers. Restating at length\n   material from other DNS literature, including RFCs, appears to this\n   reviewer to wander from the intended scope and purpose of this proposed\n   revision to RFC3901.\n",
