            <t>
                Despite IPv6 being first discussed in the mid-1990s <xref target="RFC2460"/>, consistent deployment throughout the whole Internet has not yet been accomplished <xref target="RFC9386"/>.
                Hence, today, the Internet is a mixture of IPv4, dual-stack (networks connected via both IP versions), and IPv6 networks.
            </t>
            <t>
                This creates a complex landscape where authoritative DNS servers might be accessible only via specific network protocols <xref target="V6DNSRDY-23"/>.
                At the same time, DNS resolvers may only be able to access the Internet via either IPv4 or IPv6.
                This poses a challenge for such resolvers because they may encounter names for which queries must be directed to authoritative DNS servers with which they do not share an IP version during the name resolution process.
            </t>
            <t>
                <xref target="RFC3901"/> was initially written at a time when IPv6 deployment was not widespread, focusing primarily on maintaining name space continuity within the IPv4 landscape.
                Now, nearly two decades later, with IPv6 not only widely deployed but also becoming the de facto standard in many areas,
                this document seeks to expand the scope of RFC3901 by recommending IPv6 compatibility for authoritative DNS servers, as well as recursive and stub DNS resolvers.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document provides guidance on:

            <t>
                While transitional technologies and dual-stack setups may mitigate some of the issues of DNS resolution in a mixed protocol-version Internet, making DNS data accessible over both IPv4 and IPv6 is the most robust and flexible approach, as it allows resolvers to reach the information they need without requiring intermediary translation or forwarding services which may introduce additional failure cases.

            <t>
                A resolver that tries to look up a name starts out at the root, and follows referrals until it is referred to a name server that is authoritative for the name.
                If somewhere down the chain of referrals it is referred to a name server that is, based on the referral, only accessible over a transport which the resolver cannot use, the resolver is unable to continue DNS resolution.
            </t>
            <t>
                If this occurs, the DNS has, effectively, fragmented based on the recursive DNS resolver's and authoritative DNS server's mismatching IP version support.
            </t>
            <t>
                In a mixed IP Internet, name space fragmentation can occur for different reasons.
                One reason is that DNS zones are consistently configured to support only either IPv4 or IPv6.
                Another reason is due to misconfigurations that make a zone unresolvable by either IPv4 or IPv6-only resolvers.
                The latter cases are often hard to identify, as the impact of misconfigurations for only one IP version (IPv4 or IPv6) may be hidden in a dual-stack setting.
                In the worst case, a specific name may only be resolvable via dual-stack enabled resolvers.
            </t>

                <name>Misconfigurations Causing IP Version Related Name Space Fragmentation</name>
                <t>
                    Even when an administrator assumes that they have enabled support for a specific IP version on their authoritative DNS server, various misconfigurations may break the DNS delegation chain of a zone for that protocol and prevent any of its records from resolving for clients only supporting that IP version.
                    These misconfigurations can be kept hidden if most clients can successfully fall back to the other IP version.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The following name related misconfigurations can cause broken delegation for one IP version:

                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        If all of the NS records for a zone in their parent zone have either only A records or only AAAA records, then resolution via the other IP version is not possible.

                        If the name from an NS record for a zone is in-domain, i.e., the name is within the zone or below, a parent zone must contain both IPv4 and IPv6 GLUE records, i.e., a parent must serve the corresponding A and AAAA records as ADDITIONAL data when returning the NS record(s) as the referral response.

                        If an NS record of a child zone, either provided by the parent or from the child zone's apex, points to a name in the NS RDATA that is in-domain but the name does not contain corresponding A or AAAA record(s) in the child zone,
                        name resolution via the concerned IP version will fail even if the parent provides GLUE, when the recursive DNS resolver revalidates the delegation path <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-ns-revalidation"/>.

                    <dd>
                        If the name from an NS record for a zone is sibling domain, the corresponding zone must be resolvable via the IP version in question as well.
                        It is insufficient if the name pointed to by the NS record has an associated A or AAAA record correspondingly.

                    <dd>
                        For a zone to be resolvable via an IP version the parent zones up to the root zone must be resolvable via that IP version as well.
                        Any zone not resolvable via the concerned IP version breaks the delegation chain for all its children.

                    The above misconfigurations are not mutually exclusive.

                <t>
                    Furthermore, any of the misconfigurations above may not only materialize via a missing Resource Record (RR) but also via an RR providing the IP address of a nameserver that is not configured to answer queries via that IP version <xref target="V6DNSRDY-23"/>.

                <t>
                    In addition to explicit misconfigurations in the served DNS zones, network conditions may also influence a resolver's ability to resolve names in a zone.
                    The most common issue here are packets requiring fragmentation given a reduced path MTU (PMTU) and MTU blackholes, i.e., packets being dropped on-path due to exceeding the MTU of the link to the next-hop without the sender being notified.
                    This can manifest in the following way:
                </t>

                        <t>
                            When using EDNS(0) to communicate support for DNS messages larger than 512 bytes <xref target="RFC6891"/> via traditional DNS-over-UDP transport according to RFC1035 <xref target="RFC1035"/>, an IP packet carrying a DNS response may exceed the PMTU for the path to a resolver.
                            If an authoritative DNS server and does not follow <xref target="RFC9715"/>, i.e., honors EDNS(0) sizes larger than 1232 bytes, it will try to fragment the packet according to the discovered PMTU.
                            Such packets mostly occur for DNSKEY responses with DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4034"/>.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            In general, DNS servers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> follow RFC9715 <xref target="RFC9715"/>, which provides additional guidance on preventing fragmentation by always using a maximum EDNS(0) size of 1232 bytes.

                        <t>
                            Additionally, DNS servers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> opt to explicitly not rely on path MTU discovery <xref target="RFC4821"/> or PLPMTUD <xref target="RFC8899"/>, by instead using IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU=1 from RFC3542 <xref target="RFC3542"/> to avoid the need to perform path MTU discovery.

                            If DNS resolution over UDP fails, or if a packet exceeds the communicated EDNS(0) size, a resolver should fall back to DNS resolution over TCP.
                            However, similar to the case of DNS-over-UDP, DNS-over-TCP may encounter MTU blackholes, especially on IPv6, if PMTUD does not work, if the MSS honored by the authoritative DNS server leads to IP packets exceeding the PMTU.
                            In that case, similar to the case of DNS-over-UDP, DNS resolution will time out when the recursive DNS resolver did not receive a response in time.

                            <xref target="RFC9715"/> does not provide explicit guidance on mitigating this issue.
                            However, similar to the guidance in <xref target="RFC9715"/>, setting an MSS of 1220 bytes mitigates this issue.
                            It is therefore <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that DNS servers set an MSS of 1220 bytes.
                            Additionally, DNS servers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> opt to set IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU=1 from RFC3542 <xref target="RFC3542"/>.

                            Similar to authoritative servers, (stub) recursive resolvers may face broken IPv6 connectivity, e.g., if a client has been assigned a global unicast IPv6 address, but IPv6 traffic is not routed on the resolver's network.
                            Furthermore, broken IPv6 connectivity may be encountered when IPv4-IPv6 transition technologies, e.g., NAT64 on IPv6-mostly networks <xref target="RFC9313"/>, or NAT64 connectivity discovered through PREF64 <xref target="RFC6146"/> or RFC7050 <xref target="RFC7050"/> on IPv6-only networks are in use.
                            There, the synthesized IPv6 addresses used in XLAT <xref target="RFC6877"/> encounter additional PMTU fluctuation due to the difference in header size between IPv4 and IPv6.

                <name>Reasons for Intentional IP Version Related Name Space Fragmentation</name>
                <t>
                    Intentional IP related name space fragmentation occurs if an operator consciously decides not to deploy IPv4 or IPv6 for a part of the resolution chain.
                    Most commonly, this is realized by intentionally not listing A/AAAA records for NS names.
                    At the time of writing, the share of zones not resolvable via IPv4 is negligible, while a little less than 40% of zones are not resolvable via IPv6 <xref target="V6DNSRDY-23"/>.
                    However, as IPv4 exhaustion progresses, IPv6 adoption will have to increase.

                With the final exhaustion of IPv4 pools in RIRs, e.g., <xref target="RIPEV4"/>, and the progressing deployment of IPv6, IPv4 and IPv6 have become comparably relevant.
                Yet, while we now observe the first zones becoming exclusively IPv6 resolvable, we also still see a major portion of zones solely relying on IPv4 <xref target="V6DNSRDY-23"/>.
                Hence, at the moment, dual stack connectivity is instrumental to be able to resolve zones and avoid name space fragmentation.

            <t>
                Having zones served only by name servers reachable via one IP version would fragment the DNS.
                Hence, we need to find a way to avoid this fragmentation.
            </t>
            <t>
                The recommended approach to maintain name space continuity is to use administrative policies, as described in this section.

                    It is usually recommended that DNS zones contain at least two name servers, which are geographically diverse and operate under different routing policies <xref target="IANANS"/>.
                    To reduce the chance of DNS name space fragmentation, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that at least two name servers for a zone are dual stack name servers.
                    Specifically, this means that the following minimal requirements <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be implemented for a zone:
                </t>

                            Every DNS zone <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be served by at least one IPv4-reachable authoritative DNS server to maintain name space continuity.
                            The delegation configuration (Resolution of the parent, resolution of sibling domain names, GLUE) <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> rely on IPv6 connectivity being available.
                            As we acknowledge IPv4 scarcity, operators <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> opt not to provide DNS services via IPv4, if they can ensure that all clients expected to resolve this zone do support DNS resolution via IPv6.

                            Every DNS zone <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be served by at least one IPv6-reachable authoritative DNS server to maintain name space continuity.
                            To avoid reachability issues, authoritative DNS servers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use native IPv6 addresses instead of IPv6 addresses synthesized using IPv6 transition technologies for receiving queries.
                            The delegation configuration (Resolution of the parent, resolution of sibling domain names, GLUE) <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> rely on IPv4 connectivity being available.

                            Both IPv4 and IPv6 transports should serve identical DNS data to ensure a consistent resolution experience across different network types.

                            IP fragmentation has been reported to be fragile <xref target="RFC8900"/>.
                            Furthermore, IPv6 transition technologies can introduce unexpected MTU breaks, e.g., when NAT64 is used <xref target="RFC7269"/>.
                            Therefore, IP fragmentation <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be avoided by following guidance on maximum DNS payload sizes <xref target="RFC9715"/> and providing TCP fall-back options <xref target="RFC7766"/>.
                            Furthermore, similar to the guidance in <xref target="RFC9715"/>, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> that authoritative DNS servers sets an MSS of 1220 in TCP sessions carrying DNS responses.

                <t>
                    Every recursive DNS resolver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be dual stack.
                </t>
                <t>
                    While the zones that IPv6-only recursive DNS resolvers can resolve are growing, they do not yet cover all zones.
                    Hence, a recursive DNS resolver <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be IPv6-only, if it uses a transition mechanism that allows it to also query IPv4-only authoritative DNS server or uses a configuration where it forwards queries failing IPv6-only DNS resolution to a recursive DNS resolver that is able to perform DNS resolution over IPv4.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If a recursive DNS resolver operates in a network that uses XLAT <xref target="RFC6877"/>, and the recursive DNS resolver is aware of the PREF64 <xref target="RFC6146"/> in use in its administrative domain, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> synthesize mapped IPv6 addresses for remote authoritative DNS servers directly, instead of relying on the socket translation layer of the operating system.
                    When available, a recursive DNS resolver <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> prefer using non-synthesized IPv6 addresses, instead of using NAT64 connectivity discovered through a PREF64<xref target="RFC6146"/> or RFC7050 <xref target="RFC7050"/>.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Similarly, a recursive DNS resolver <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be IPv4-only, if it uses a configuration where such resolvers forward queries failing IPv4-only DNS resolution to a recursive DNS resolver that is able to perform DNS resolution over IPv6.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Finally, when responding to recursive queries sent by stub DNS resolvers, a DNS resolver <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> follow the above guidance for communication between authoritative DNS servers and recursive DNS resolvers analogously.
                </t>

            <section anchor="guidelines-for-dns-stub">
                <name>Guidelines for DNS Stub Resolvers</name>
                <t>
                    In general, DNS Stub Resolvers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> follow the same guidance as outlined for recursive DNS resolvers when they are deployed to a dual-stack network not using IPv4-IPv6 transition techniques.
                    Contrary to authoritative DNS servers and recursive DNS resolvers, stub DNS resolvers are more likely to find themselves in either an IPv6 mostly or IPv4 only environment, as they are usually run on end-hosts / clients.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For IPv4 only environments, a stub DNS resolver has to rely on the provided recursive DNS server following guidance in this document.
                    However, in a XLAT <xref target="RFC6877"/> scenario using RFC1918 addressing <xref target="RFC1918"/>, the environment may be indistinguishable from a dual-stack scenario, and the host running the stub DNS resolver may receive multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for possible DNS resolvers to use via different protocols (DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC3456"/>, DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"/>, SLAAC <xref target="RFC4862"/>).
                </t>
                <t>
                    Hence, when a host running a stub DNS resolver receives addresses for IPv4 and IPv6 recursive DNS resolver to use, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> prioritize reachable IPv6 recursive DNS resolvers.
                    When available, a stub DNS resolver <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> prefer using non-synthesized IPv6 addresses, instead of using NAT64 connectivity discovered through a PREF64<xref target="RFC6146"/> or RFC7050 <xref target="RFC7050"/>.
                    If a stub DNS resolver runs in an IPv6-mostly network <xref target="RFC9313"/>, and the stub DNS resolver is aware of the used PREF64 <xref target="RFC6146"/>, it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> synthesize mapped IPv6 addresses for remote authoritative DNS servers directly, instead of relying on the socket translation layer of the operating system.
